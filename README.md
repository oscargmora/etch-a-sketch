<h3 align="center">Etch-A-Sketch</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project demonstrates my skills in DOM Manipulation, as well as proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    The etch-a-sketch taught me a number of valuable lessons.
    <br />
    1) Googling is absolutely essential to a programmers job. There is no way I could have completed this without googling.
    <br />
    2) Mouse functions. I noticed it was difficult to get the mousedown functionality to stay down even when clicking and dragging. It took me some playing around and stackOverflow to figure out exactly how to get this to work.
    <br />
    3) Dark Mode UI. I decided to make this in dark mode for a few reasons. One, who doesn't like dark mode? Two, I wanted to experiment with saturations, opacity, and different colors to see what goes well. I did not add a switch here to change from light mode to dark mode, but I know it is key to allow the user to decide which mode they prefer.
    <br />
    4) Sliders. I was lucky that W3Schools had a whole lesson on this and it taught me exactly how to setup a slider if I ever need one.
    <br />
    5) Patience is key. This one is self-explanatory, but I felt this was a lot harder project to tackle from the previous ones. There were times I needed to step away and come back, and would often see the solution to my problem. This along with not being afraid to ask for help, really allowed me to excel at this project.
